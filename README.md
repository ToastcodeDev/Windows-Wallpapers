# <h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> Inspired by Microsoft's 2021 Sun Valley update for Windows and numerous other styles, I've created a collection of wallpapers. </p>

# <h2> Freshness </h2>

<p> They have been molded with the type of gradient color since it is simpler to combine and also because it stands out more with the Sun Valley update and more. </p>

# <h2> Versions </h2>

<p> Every time there is a new wallpaper, a new version will be created, this will be that you can differentiate the wallpapers and so you take the ones you like, although I also invite you to check the other versions, surely they have another that you may like. </p>
